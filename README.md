Some updated bindings for FreeBasic 1.07.1

Here are some updated bindings for FreeBasic 1.07.1.
Currently I'm still working on some so more changes are to be expected. If some examples/code you can find on other repos here fail, chances are that your bindings are out of date (most likely the case with the MySQL bindings). So, download them and install as appropriate and you should be able to compile them successfully.
